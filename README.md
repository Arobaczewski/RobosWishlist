## 🎯 Project Overview

Robo's Wishlist is a personal e-commerce wishlist application that showcases my full-stack development capabilities while maintaining a unique, personal touch. Every product featured is something I've genuinely researched and added to my real wishlist—from development tools to dream items. This project demonstrates my ability to build production-ready applications with complex state management, authentication, and user experience features.

**What makes this different?** Unlike typical portfolio projects with dummy data, every aspect of this site—from the purple gradient color scheme to each individual product—reflects my personal taste, goals, and identity. It's proof that I can build beautiful, functional applications while being a real person with goals, hobbies, and a healthy sense of humor about my own ambitions.

## 💡 Why This Project?

As a developer transitioning into web development, I wanted to create a portfolio project that demonstrated my full-stack capabilities while being something I'd actually use. Building a wishlist site allowed me to:

- Work with modern technologies (Next.js, TypeScript, Redux)
- Implement complex state management and authentication
- Create a polished, production-ready user interface
- Show attention to detail and design thinking
- Demonstrate my ability to see a project through from concept to deployment

But beyond the technical stack, I wanted potential employers to see who I am as a person. The products I choose tell a story about my goals, my interests, and my ambitions—from the development tools I need now to the dream items that keep me motivated.

## 📈 Future Enhancements
